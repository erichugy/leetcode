    "Solar power consumption has increased due to concern over global warming. Some Amazon offices have decided to replace some of their electricity-powered bulbs with solar-powered bulbs. Here electricity-powered means using a wired supply of electricity and solar powered means powered by an indepenedent solar panel.\n",

    "In one such office the lights are arrached sequentially represented by a binary sequence, bulbs. The electricity-powered bulbs are represented by '0' and the solar-powered bulbs are '1'. \n",

    "It is desired to have as many solar-powered bulbs as possible, btu the electrivity powered ones are brighter than the solar-powered bulbs. An elextrivity powered bulb can be replaced by a solar-pwered bulb only if the new soar-powered bulb is not adjacent to a solar-powered bulb. More formally, a '0' can be replaced by a 1 if and only if it does't become adjacent to amother 1 on replcaement. \n",
