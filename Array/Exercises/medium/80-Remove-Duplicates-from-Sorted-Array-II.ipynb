    "# Removing Duplicates from Sorted Array (Allowing Duplicates)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time complexity: `O(n)` - The array is traversed only once.\n",
    "- Space complexity: `O(1)` - No extra space is used; duplicates are removed in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algo:\n",
    "- The algorithm is designed to remove duplicates from a sorted array in place, allowing each element to appear at most twice.\n",
    "- Steps:\n",
    "    1. Start with two pointers: `k` as the slow-runner and `i` as the fast-runner.\n",
    "    2. Initialize `k` to 1, since the first two elements can be allowed without checks.\n",
    "    3. Iterate through the array starting from the third element (`i = 2`).\n",
    "    4. Use the `lag` variable to look one element behind `k` for comparison.\n",
    "    5. If the current element is different from the ones at `k` and `lag`, copy it to the position after `k`, and increment `k`.\n",
    "    6. Increment `i` with each iteration of the loop to continue checking subsequent elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example:\n",
    "- Given a sorted array `nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, the method would modify it to `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]` and return the new length `6`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Details:\n",
    "- The method `removeDuplicates` is a member of the `Solution` class.\n",
    "- The method operates directly on the input array `nums`, modifying it without needing extra storage.\n",
    "- It efficiently identifies and skips duplicates by comparing the current element with the last two unique elements found.\n",
    "- The returned value is the length of the array after the removal of extra duplicates.\n",

    "        Loop:\n",
    "          if nums[k] != nums[i] then nums[++k] = nums[i]\n",
    "          i ++\n",
    "        end: return k + 1\n",
    "        */\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Idea is to use first pointer to iterate\n",
    "        // Use second pointer to fill array\n",
    "        // if the last element was nums[i] as well, just increment i to find next unique element\n",
    "        // if the last element was not nums[i], then increment k and add the element to the list\n",
