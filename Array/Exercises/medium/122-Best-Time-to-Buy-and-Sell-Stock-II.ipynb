    "# Maximize Stock Trading Profit Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time complexity: `O(n)` - We iterate through the array of prices only once.\n",
    "- Space complexity: `O(1)` - No additional space is needed; calculations are done using a few variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algo:\n",
    "- The algorithm aims to maximize the profit from stock price changes by simulating continuous buying and selling.\n",
    "- Steps:\n",
    "    1. **Initialization**: Set `left` to 0 to represent the buy day, and `right` to 1 to represent the sell day.\n",
    "    2. Loop while `right` is less than the length of `prices`.\n",
    "        - Calculate `curr` profit or loss by subtracting the price at `left` from the price at `right`.\n",
    "        - If `curr` is positive (profit), add it to `total`.\n",
    "        - Move `left` to `right`, and increment `right` to move to the next day.\n",
    "    3. **Termination**: When `right` reaches the end of `prices`, the loop ends.\n",
    "    4. The `total` variable represents the accumulated profit from all transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example:\n",
    "- Given `prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]`, the method would calculate the profits as `4` (buy at `1`, sell at `5`), `3` (buy at `3`, sell at `6`), for a total profit of `7`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Details:\n",
    "- The `maxProfit` method is a member of the `Solution` class.\n",
    "- It simulates buying and selling on each rising edge to maximize profit.\n",
    "- The total profit is calculated by summing up the profits from each transaction.\n",
    "- Edge cases like an array of length 1 are handled at the beginning, returning `0` as no profit is possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code:\n",
    "```Java\n",
    "class Solution {\n",
    "    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {\n",
    "        /*\n",
    "        Prev solution:\n",
    "        Initialization:\n",
    "            left = 0 \n",
    "            right = 1\n",
    "        Loop:\n",
    "            curr = nums[left] - nums[right]\n",
    "\n",
    "            (Note seems that there are no duplicate prices)\n",
    "            curr < 0 -> found a smaller min @ right, set min to be nums[right]\n",
    "\n",
    "            otherwise, update max profit\n",
    "        Termination:\n",
    "            Will terminate when there are no prices to iterate over anymore\n",
    "            Will leave maxProfit as the max of all maxprofits\n",
    "         */\n",
    "        /*\n",
    "        New Solution:\n",
    "        Why not just buy and sell on the max day before a new min is found?\n",
    "        Why not just constantly buy and sell every time you can?\n",
    "        Proof:\n",
    "            Let's graph the problem as a hailstone problem\n",
    "            To maximize profit, need to capitalize on every single rising edge.\n",
    "            So total profit = sum(risingEdge)\n",
    "            Proof left to the reader. \n",
    "            Hint: \n",
    "                Supposed there are no falling edges, then total profit = the single rising edge\n",
    "                If there are falling edges, adding all the rising edges = if there were no rising edges + mag of all falling edges (assuming an increasing graph)\n",
