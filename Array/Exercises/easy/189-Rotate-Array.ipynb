    "# In-Place Array Rotation Using Reversal\n",

    "- Space complexity: `O(1)` - No extra space is used; the reversal is done in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algo:\n",
    "- This algorithm rotates an array `nums` by `k` steps to the right, using a reversal strategy.\n",
    "- Steps:\n",
    "    1. Normalize `k`: Ensure that the number of rotations `k` does not exceed the length of the array (`k %= len(nums)`).\n",
    "    2. Reverse the entire array: `nums.reverse()` flips the whole array.\n",
    "    3. Reverse the first `k` elements: `nums[:k] = reversed(nums[:k])` corrects the order of the first `k` elements.\n",
    "    4. Reverse the remaining elements: `nums[k:] = reversed(nums[k:])` corrects the order of the elements from `k` to the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example:\n",
    "- If we have `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` and `k = 3`, after applying the rotation, `nums` will be `[5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.\n",

    "- A class `Solution` with a method `rotate` modifies the list `nums` in place.\n",
