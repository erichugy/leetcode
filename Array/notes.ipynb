    "        - Here, since you must buy a stock before you can sell it, you can use a two pointer system where you always have the right pointer at least one ahead of the left.\n",
    "        - Then, if the price of the right pointer is smaller than the price of the left pointer, we know that we've found a lower valley than the one we currently have as the left pointer -> update left pointer to be the right pointer\n",
    "            - the min valley up of the elements we've scanned thus far will yield the largest profits for any peaks in the future\n",
    "        - Otherwise, check if we're looking at the highest peak out of the elements we've scanned.\n",
    "            - Do this by calculating the profit and determining if it greater than the current profit\n",
