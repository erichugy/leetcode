    "## General Algorithms\n",
    "1) **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**\n",
    "    - Time Complexity ```O(n)```\n",
    "    - Space complexity: ```O(1)```\n",
    "    - **Algo**\n",
    "        - Loop:\n",
    "        ```Java\n",
    "            if nums[k] != nums[i] then nums[++k] = nums[i];\n",
    "            i ++;\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        - End: ```return k + 1```\n",
    "    - **Algo for which allows duplicates**:\n",
    "        - Idea is to use first pointer to iterate `i`\n",
    "        - Use second pointer to fill array `k`\n",
    "        - if the last element was `nums[i]` as well, just increment `i` to find next unique element\n",
    "        - if the last element was not `nums[i]`, then increment `k` and add the element to the list\n",
    "        - Return `k+1`\n",
    "    - Ex: \n",
    "        - 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array\n",
    "        - 80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II\n",
    "2) **Boyer-Moore Majority Vote Algorithm**\n",
    "    - Time complexity: `O(n)`\n",
    "    - Space complexity: `O(1)`\n",
    "    - **Algo**:\n",
    "    - Designed to find the majority element in an array (appearing more than `n/2` times).\n",
    "    - The algorithm uses a two-step approach:\n",
    "        1. **Candidate Selection**:\n",
    "            - Initialize two variables: `candidate` (potential majority element) and `count` (count of candidate's occurrences).\n",
    "            - Iterate through each element in the array.\n",
    "            - If `count` is 0, set the current element as `candidate`.\n",
    "            - If the current element equals `candidate`, increment `count`.\n",
    "            - If not, decrement `count`.\n",
    "        2. **Majority Verification** (Optional):\n",
    "            - Reset `count` to 0.\n",
    "            - Iterate through the array to count the occurrences of `candidate`.\n",
    "            - If `count` is greater than `n/2`, `candidate` is confirmed as the majority element.\n",
    "    - Ex:\n",
    "        - Determine the majority element in a given array, like identifying the most frequent item in a dataset.\n",
    "3) **Rotate Array**\n",
    "    - Many different algorithms\n",
    "        - Create a reversed array copy\n",
    "            - O(n) extra space & O(n) Runtime\n",
    "        - Reversing Method\n",
    "            - O(1) extra space & O(n) Runtime\n",
    "            - Reverse the whole list\n",
    "            - Reverse k-elements (beg of list)\n",
    "            - Reverse the rest of the list\n",
    "        - Cyclic Replacement\n",
    "            - Trick: `next_idx = (current + k) % n`\n",

    "    - Time complexity: ```O(n)```\n",
    "    - Space complexity: ```O(1)```\n",
    "    - **Algo**:  \n",
    "        - Use a two-pointer system to simulate buying and selling stock:\n",
    "        - The right pointer is always at least one step ahead of the left.\n",
    "        - If the right pointer's price is less than the left pointer's, update the left pointer to the right pointer's position, identifying a new lower valley.\n",
    "        - If not, calculate the potential profit if the current peak is higher than previously encountered peaks and update the current profit if greater.\n",
    "    - Ex: \n",
    "        - Find the Best Time to Buy and Sell a Stock (121)\n",
    "2) Group Anagrams\n",
    "    - let `n` = number of words\n",
