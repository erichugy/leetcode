    "#### Intuition\n",
    "We have implemented various templates of binary search, now let's quickly go through the last approach that uses built-in functions. Python provides `bisect` module which also supports binary search functions. If we are solving some standard problems that do not require a lot of customization, it's feasible to rely on these built-in tools to save time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `upper_bound` and `bisect.bisect_right` look for the rightmost insertion position and bring the same result as approach 2, while `lower_bound` and `bisect.bisect_left` look for the leftmost insertion position and end up with the same result as approach 3. Once we find the insertion position, check if the value at the corresponding position equals target.\n",

    "Here we implement the method that uses `upper_bound` or `bisect.bisect_right` and leave another half as a practice!\n",

    "Use built-in tools to locate the rightmost insertion position `idx`.\n",
    "If `idx > 0` and `nums[idx - 1] = target`, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.\n",
