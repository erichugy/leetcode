    "2) <b>While `left <= right`:</b>\n",
    "    - Find the midpoint of the `range (left, right)` in the variable `mid = (left + right) / 2`.\n",
    "    - Compare the letter at index `mid` with `target`. If `letters[mid] <= target`, it means all the characters at indices smaller or equal to `mid` would also be smaller than `target` because the characters in `letters` are sorted. As a result, we move to upper half of the range by setting `left = mid + 1`.\n",
    "    - Otherwise, it means all the characters at indices greater or equal to `mid` would also be greater than `target` because the characters in `letters` are sorted. As a result, we move to lower half of the range by setting `right = mid - 1`.\n",
    "    - At the end of the binary search algorithm, `left` will store the index of the smallest character that is lexicographically greater than `target`.\n",
    "3) If ```left == letters.length```, it means there is no character in letters that is lexicographically greater than `target`. We return ```letters[0]```. Otherwise, we return `letters[left]` as `left` holds the smallest character greater than `target`.\n",
