    "# Minimum Number of Jumps to Reach End\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time complexity: Potentially `O(n^2)` due to the nested loops.\n",
    "- Space complexity: `O(n)` for the memoization array.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algo:\n",
    "- The algorithm utilizes dynamic programming with memoization to find the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the last index of the array.\n",
    "- Steps:\n",
    "    1. **Base Case Handling**: If the array length is 1, return 0 since no jumps are needed.\n",
    "    2. Initialize a memoization array `mem` to store the minimum number of jumps needed to reach each index.\n",
    "    3. Set the first element of `mem` to 0 as the starting point.\n",
    "    4. Loop over each index `i` of the array.\n",
    "        - Retrieve the current number of jumps from `mem[i]`.\n",
    "        - Inner loop backwards from `nums[i]` down to 1 to find the farthest reachable index.\n",
    "        - If `mem[i + j]` is non-zero, break as this index is already reachable with fewer or the same jumps.\n",
    "        - Otherwise, set `mem[i + j]` to `jumps + 1`.\n",
    "    5. The last element of `mem` gives the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example:\n",
    "- Given `nums = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]`, the method would return `2`, as the minimum number of jumps to reach the end is two (jump from index 0 to 1, then from index 1 to the end).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Details:\n",
    "- The `jump` method is a member of the `Solution` class.\n",
    "- Memoization is used to avoid recalculating the minimum number of jumps for each index.\n",
    "- The solution iterates over each element and updates the memoization array with the minimum jumps needed to reach further indices.\n",
    "- The memoization array is initialized with zeros and updated in place.\n"
